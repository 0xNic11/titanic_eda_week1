# Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (Week 1 Mini Project)

This repository contains my Week 1 Data Science & Machine Learning roadmap project: an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset.  
The goal of this project is to understand demographic patterns, visualize key features, and explore survival differences across sex, class, and age groups.

## 📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes the classic Titanic dataset using Pandas and Matplotlib.  
It focuses on:

- Understanding passenger demographics  
- Visualizing distributions (Age, Fare, Class, Sex)  
- Exploring the relationship between features and survival outcomes  
- Creating engineered features such as **AgeGroup**  
- Summarizing key findings that will guide machine learning work in future weeks  

This EDA serves as the foundation for more advanced modeling tasks later in the roadmap.
